                    Ever wonder what is the second most important part about
                    eating out, shopping, going to the
                    movies, partying on Saturday, picnicking in the
                    park or strolling down Main street?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bathrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's true, we rate just about everything these days...
                    except bathrooms. They are an integral part of our lives and
                    our enjoyment of any experience.
                    That is why we created REGULAR.
